///////////////////// GPT //////////////////////
1. Authentication & Authorization
    User Registration:
    [ ] - Ensure users can register with MetaMask.
    [ ] - Verify that a unique Nonce is generated and stored.
    [ ] - Validate user input (e.g., email, birthdate) during registration.
    [ ] - Ensure the backend handles duplicate registrations appropriately.

    Login Flow:
    [ ] - Check if users can log in via MetaMask and sign the nonce.
    [ ] - Verify that the backend correctly verifies the signed nonce.
    [ ] - Ensure JWT token generation after successful login.
    [ ] - Implement session management (e.g., JWT token expiry, refresh tokens).

    Authorization:
    [ ] - Implement role-based access control (e.g., user, admin).
    [ ] - Ensure protected routes are only accessible by authorized users.

    Logout:
    [ ] - Ensure users can log out and invalidate their session.
    [ ] - Handle JWT token invalidation on logout.

2. Front-End Functionality
    MetaMask Integration:
    [ ] - Ensure MetaMask is detected and integrated properly.
    [ ] - Check for account change events and update the UI accordingly.
    [ ] - Provide feedback if MetaMask is not detected.

    Forms & Data Handling:
    [ ] - Validate form inputs (e.g., required fields, correct formats).
    [ ] - Implement proper error handling and display error messages to the user.
    [ ] - Ensure form data is sent correctly to the backend.

    User Interface (UI):
    [ ] - Ensure a consistent and responsive design across devices.
    [ ] - Provide visual feedback (e.g., loading indicators, success messages).
    [ ] - Ensure accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

    Navigation:
    [ ] - Ensure navigation between pages is smooth and maintains state.
    [ ] - Implement redirects after successful login, registration, or logout.
    [ ] - Handle unauthorized access with proper redirects (e.g., to login page).

    Dashboard:
    [ ] - Display user-specific information (e.g., profile details, account balance).
    [ ] - Implement features like viewing and editing profile data.
    [ ] - Ensure data is fetched and displayed correctly from the backend.
3. Back-End Services
    API Endpoints:
    [ ] - Ensure all API endpoints are functioning as expected.
    [ ] - Validate input data on the server-side.
    [ ] - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for different scenarios (e.g., success, error, not found).

    Database Management:
    [ ] - Ensure the database schema matches the application needs (e.g., fields for Nonce, WalletAddress).
    [ ] - Implement proper indexing for faster queries (e.g., on WalletAddress).
    [ ] - Handle database migrations smoothly and ensure data integrity.

    Logging & Monitoring:
    [ ] - Implement logging for critical actions (e.g., user registration, login attempts).
    [ ] - Monitor API performance and error rates.
    [ ] - Set up alerts for critical failures or unusual activity.

4. Security
    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
    [ ] - Ensure CORS is configured correctly to allow requests from your frontend.
    [ ] - Limit allowed origins, methods, and headers.
    
    HTTPS/SSL:
    [ ] - Ensure the backend is using HTTPS in production.
    [ ] - Handle SSL certificates correctly (e.g., avoid mixed content issues).

    Data Validation & Sanitization:
    [ ] - Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
    [ ] - Implement strong validation on all user inputs.

    Token Security:
    [ ] - Ensure JWT tokens are signed and validated correctly.
    [ ] - Implement token expiration and refresh logic.
    [ ] - Securely store tokens on the client-side (e.g., HttpOnly cookies, local storage).

    Role-Based Access Control:
    [ ] - Implement role-based permissions in the backend.
    [ ] - Ensure users cannot access unauthorized resources or perform restricted actions.

5. Performance Optimization
    Load Times:
    [ ] - Optimize the loading time of your app (e.g., minimize JavaScript/CSS, use lazy loading).
    [ ] - Implement caching for static resources.

    Database Performance:
    [ ] - Ensure queries are optimized for speed.
    [ ] - Use connection pooling for database connections.

    API Performance:
    [ ] - Optimize the performance of API endpoints (e.g., reduce payload sizes).
    [ ] - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

    Asset Management:
    [ ] - Compress and optimize images and other static assets.
    [ ] - Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets.

6. Testing
    Unit Tests:
    [ ] - Write unit tests for key components (e.g., authentication logic, form validation).
    [ ] - Ensure unit tests cover edge cases and potential failure points.

    Integration Tests:
    [ ] - Implement integration tests to verify the interaction between components (e.g., frontend-to-backend communication).
    [ ] - Test the full authentication flow with MetaMask.

    End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
    [ ] - Automate E2E tests for critical user journeys (e.g., registration, login, dashboard access).
    [ ] - Use tools like Cypress or Selenium for browser-based testing.

7. User Experience (UX)
    Feedback & Messaging:
    [ ] - Provide clear feedback for user actions (e.g., success, errors).
    [ ] - Implement user-friendly error messages and guidance.

    Onboarding & Tutorials:
    [ ] - Implement onboarding flows or tutorials for new users.
